  attr/attr2 = different kinds of attributes (settings) for the tag
  value/value2 = values for the attributes that are being set within the tag

			<h2>The Superleggera</h2>

			<p>While the frame exploits the inherent lightness and flexibility of ashwood, the seat surround is in beech, which is more close-grained and stronger. The wood parts are created by machine, and hand-finished, glue being applied with a brush, the excess being wiped off, and the seat being hand-woven. Thus do crafts expertise and industrial innovation come together in what we could call a “prime object”, informed by the chair-making traditions of Chiavari, in Liguria, northern Italy.</p>
